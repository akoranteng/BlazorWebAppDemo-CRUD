# Blazor Web App Demo — CRUD Learning Path

This repository provides a clean Blazor Web App foundation designed specifically for EF Core integration, database migrations, and CRUD development. It is built from scratch to avoid template conflicts and ensure a stable environment for backend learning.

## Purpose
Repo #2 serves as the hands-on learning path for:
- Setting up EF Core in a Blazor Web App  
- Creating and applying database migrations  
- Building a full CRUD workflow (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- Documenting each step as a teaching milestone  

## Structure
Each branch in this repository represents a focused learning module, progressing from a clean project setup to a fully functional CRUD application.

## Status
The repository is newly initialized and ready for the first milestone: creating the base Blazor Web App project.
